# Python's built-in logging package in Python

Logging in software enginering, and development is the activity of adding code into the softare code artifact to record, and store code execusion and activities.  This process helps in debuging the execution of the software when all is well.  As an automation engineer, i first started using logging in development of aunit testing code,

computing, a log file is a file that records either events that occur in an operating system or other software runs,[1] or messages between different users of a communication software. Logging is the act of keeping a log. In the simplest case, messages are written to a single log file.


allows programmers and software developers to track events that happen in their software, it can not only track the actual event, but when it occured and in which function and even in which line.

Useful logs doesn't only help us debug our errors, but it can provide us with a tremendous help when trying to understand what a particular code is actually doing. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Python's built-in logging package in Python.
