# Python's built-in logging package in Python

Logging in software engineering, and development is the activity of adding code into the software code artefact to record and store code excursions and activities. This process helps in debugging the execution of the software when all is well. As an automation engineer, I first started using logging in development of unit testing code, and today's collaborative software development and modularity of software means the need for greater logging, and greater granularity from Loggins is desired.



computing, a log file is a file that records either events that occur in an operating system or other software runs,[1] or messages between different users of a communication software. Logging is the act of keeping a log. In the simplest case, messages are written to a single log file.


allows programmers and software developers to track events that happen in their software, it can not only track the actual event, but when it occured and in which function and even in which line.

Useful logs doesn't only help us debug our errors, but it can provide us with a tremendous help when trying to understand what a particular code is actually doing. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Python's built-in logging package in Python.
